                        In 2012, 11.1 million foreign tourists visited South Korea, 
                        making it the 20th most visited country in the world, 
                        up from 8.5 million in 2010. Due to Hallyu, South Korea welcomed 
                        more than 12 million visitors in 2013 with 6 million tourists coming 
                        from China alone. With rising tourist prospects, especially 
                        from foreign countries outside of Asia, the South Korean government 
                        has set a target of attracting 20 million foreign tourists a year by 
                        2017.

                        industry are not limited to within its culture industry, according to 
                        a study by the Hyundai Research Institute. The Hyundai Research 
                        Institute reported that the Korean Wave has a direct impact in encouraging 
                        direct foreign investment back into the country through demand for products, 
                        and the tourism industry. Among Asian countries, China was the most receptive, 
                        investing 1.4 billion in South Korea, with much of the investment within its service s

                        shown an analysis that a 1 percent increase of exports of Korean cultural 
                        content pushes consumer goods exports up 0.083 percent while a 1 percent 
                        increase in Korean pop content exports to a country produces a 0.019 percent 
                        bump in tourism.

                    The history of South Korea formally begins with its establishment on 17 August 1948, although
                    Syngman Rhee had officially declared independence two days prior.

                    Korea was administratively partitioned in 1945, at the end of World War II. 
                    As Korea was under Japanese rule during World War II, Korea was officially a 
                    belligerent against the Allied Powers. The unconditional surrender of Japan 
                    led to the division of Korea into two occupation zones (similar to the four zones in Germany),
                    with the United States administering the southern half of the peninsula and the Soviet Union
                    administering the area north of the 38th parallel. This division was meant to be temporary 
                    (as was Germany) and was first intended to return a unified Korea back to its people after 
                    the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Republic of China could arrange a single government. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Soviets and Americans were unable to agree on the implementation of Joint Trusteeship over 
                    Korea. This led in 1948 to the establishment of two separate governments – the Communist-aligned 
                    Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the West-aligned First Republic of Korea – each 
                    claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea. In 1950 the Korean War broke out. 
                    After much destruction, the war ended with the 1948 status quo being restored, as neither 
                    the DPRK nor the First Republic had succeeded in conquering the other's portion of the original 
                    Korea. The peninsula was divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone and the two separate governments 
                    stabilized into the existing political entities of North and South Korea.
