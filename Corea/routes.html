                            Gyeongbokgung also known as Gyeongbokgung Palacem or Gyeongbok Palace, 
                            was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty. Built in 1395, it is located 
                            in northern Seoul, South Korea. The largest of the Five Grand Palaces 
                            built by the Joseon dynasty, Gyeongbokgung served as the home of Kings of the Joseon 
                            dynasty, the Kings' households, as well as the government of Joseon.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the 
                            premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War and abandoned for two centuries. 
                            However, in the 19th century, all of the palace's 7,700 rooms were later restored under 
                            the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during the reign of King Gojong. Some 500 
                            buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares.The architectural principles 
                            of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal 
                            court.

                            Seoul Olympic Park, shortened to Olpark, is an Olympic Park built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics. 
                            It is located in Songpa-gu, Bangi-dong.Built between December 31, 1986 and August 31, 1988, it was designed by 
                            the architect Kim Chung-up to celebrate the spirit of the Seoul Olympic Games (peace and harmony) and also 
                            to symbolize the ability of the Korean people. Alongside the pillars there are structures similar to wings, 
                            under which there's a mural called "A Painting of Four Spirits". In the mural are shown a phoenix, a turtle, a 
                            tiger and a dragon (the spirits that guard the gate) ascending towards heaven, representing the strength of Koreans 
                            and their freedom.Under the gate is an eternal flame, as well as a declaration of peace calling for world harmony and 
                            happiness for all citizens of the world.

                                Haeundae takes its name from the ninth century Silla scholar and poet Choi Chi-won 
                                (literary name Haeun, or "Sea and Clouds"), who, according to a historical account, 
                                admired the view from the beach and built a pavilion nearby. A piece of Choi's calligraphy, 
                                which he engraved on a rock at Haeundae, still exists.

                                Haeundae used to be isolated from the large communities in Busan and Busanjin. 
                                It remained undeveloped until the late 1970s and early 1980s. A small number of 
                                luxury hotels were constructed after the 1988 Seoul Olympics. More hotels and other 
                                tourist facilities have been constructed on the beach-front area since the mid-1990s, 
                                and shopping malls and movie theatre complexes have been built in the 'centre' of Haeundae: 
                                an area between Haeundae Station and the beach. The area has continued to grow, apart 
                                from during the Asian financial crisis of 1997.

                                Haedong Yonggung Temple is a Buddhist temple in Gijang-gun, Busan, South Korea. 
                                The temple was built in 1376 by the teacher known as Naong during the Goryeo Dynasty, 
                                and was originally known as Bomun Temple. It was destroyed during the Japanese 
                                invasions of Korea (1592â€“98) but was rebuilt in the 1930s, and was renamed Haedong Yonggung 
                                Temple in 1974. The temple complex is a large one and one of few in Korea to be set on the seaside.
                                As such, combined with its proximity to Haeundae Beach and the east side of Busan, the temple 
                                is popular with sightseers, particularly during Buddha's Birthday celebrations when the complex 
                                is decorated with paper lanterns.
