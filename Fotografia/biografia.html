                        Kutsova Elena is a fashion photographer who currently resides in New York City. 
                        She grew up in Moscow, Russia, where she discovered her interest in photography at an early age. 
                        She later moved to London to pursue fashion photography full-time before making NYC her home in 2011.

                        Influenced by playful narratives, color and elegance, Kutsova enjoys creating stories with a cinematic approach. 
                        She is inspired by strength, unique beauty and timeless style.

                        Being equally comfortable in front of the lens has led to several TV and digital 
                        appearances – recent influencer/ content collaborations include Barney’s x Bvlgari, 
                        Emporio Armani, Town & Country and Verizon Fios. Kutsova has also been featured as 
                        guest photographer on both Poland’s Next Top Model and DigitalRev TV.

                        Kutsova has also been fortunate enough to receive a number of sponsorships and accolades; 
                        she is sponsored by Canon UK and Broncolor.<br>
                        As well as working on her personal work, she also tutors fashion photography workshops 
                        around the globe and is a regular speaker in the photography scene – speaking at conventions 
                        and shows such as the UK Photo Show, PhotoPlus International Expo, Shoot A’Dam and Canon sponsored events.
